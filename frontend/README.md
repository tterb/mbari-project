# MBARI Angular Project

Welcome! Here are some tips on how to get started:

* Install all the dependencies for this project with `npm install`.
* **Feel free to install any packages you want! No limitations here**
* We've included the latest version of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and it's ***highly recommended*** that you actively use it (or another UI framework) as you build your UI.
* Use [feature branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) - don't ***ever*** push to the master branch.
* There's a fantastic Angular 7 crash course video located [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wtnKulcquA).
* Obviously, host your project locally with `ng serve` while you edit.
